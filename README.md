## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts

### What I learned

Display Flex requires enough components and elements to be really active.


### Continued development

I will continue to learn more on CSS Specificity as I came across a slight issue when adding color on hover state to the button element.


### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?query=big+sh) - This helped me with the needed fonts for styling this card component. I really liked the fonts and will use it going forward.
